# Cloudflare-DDNS-Update

This was a project I began working on when I founded Machine IT Services, a web hosting, web development, and IT company based in Louisville, KY.
This script has the potential to update the DNS A Records of a multitude of domains, or "zones", on Cloudflare, while also providing flexibility by allowing the update of specific subdomains, or "records", for each domain specified in the config file. You may refer to included config-example.sh for config file format.
In order to run the script, just execute it with either the config file name (if in the same directory, i.e. config.sh) or the config file location (i.e. /your/config/directory/config.sh). For assistance with the use or operation of this utility, you may email me at collin@machineitservices.com. Please no spam or soliciting.
